# Music-Analysis

ABSTRACT

Today, several music platforms provide thousand of new songs; it becomes ambitious to find highly appealing or like-able songs 
within such loads of data. In our project we have considered various attributes like acousticness, danceability, energy, 
instumentalness, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, valence and artist to find whether the audience will like the song or not. 
“1” is used to denote that the audience will like the song and “0” is used to denote that they won’t like that song. 
We have built a classifier that could predict whether or not the audience will like the song. Whole data is divided into 
two parts. 80% of the data is used as training data and the rest 20% as test data. We have used three algorithms to reach to our
result. 
1.Decision Tree 
2. Random Forest  
3. Multiple Linear Regression
